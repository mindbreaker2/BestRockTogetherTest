# BestRockTogether
Work in progress!! 
Allows minecraft bedrock player to connect to a custom server when playing on consoles.

## how to use 
your android device and your console must be on the same local network.

input server ip, server port and click "start proxy"
default port fort minecraft bedrock/pocket edition is 

## how does it work ?

The app starts a proxy on your phone, the proxy receives the packets from the client (PS5,Xbox...) and transfers it to the server ip and ports you provided.

## why ?

I've used bedrockTogether, great app but so much adds that i decided to make a free, open source version. 
I don't want to pay to put it on stores so i'll just put it here. 

# IOS users
sorry but can't do anything for you, i'll probably do a version to run on computers in order to let every one play with their friends for free.
